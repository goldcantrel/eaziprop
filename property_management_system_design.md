# Property Management SaaS System Design

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Laravel 10.x (PHP 8.2+)
- Frontend: React 18.x with TypeScript
- Database: MySQL 8.0
- Cache: Redis for session and real-time features
- File Storage: AWS S3
- Real-time: Laravel WebSockets
- Payment: Stripe API
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum + OAuth2

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Laravel Framework**: Chosen for rapid development, robust security, and excellent ORM (Eloquent)
2. **React Frontend**: Component-based architecture with TypeScript for better maintainability
3. **WebSockets**: For real-time chat and notifications
4. **AWS S3**: Scalable document storage solution
5. **Stripe**: Secure payment processing with webhook integration
6. **Redis**: For caching and WebSocket message queuing

### Security Measures
1. OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens
2. HTTPS enforcement
3. CSRF protection
4. Input validation and sanitization
5. Rate limiting on API endpoints
6. File upload validation and virus scanning
7. Data encryption at rest
8. Regular security audits

### Performance Optimizations
1. Database indexing on frequently queried fields
2. Redis caching for API responses
3. AWS CloudFront CDN for static assets
4. Lazy loading for large datasets
5. Database query optimization

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/logout
GET /api/auth/user
```

### Property Management
```
GET /api/properties
POST /api/properties
GET /api/properties/{id}
PUT /api/properties/{id}
DELETE /api/properties/{id}
```

### Rent Management
```
GET /api/rents
POST /api/rents/pay
GET /api/rents/{id}/history
```

### Maintenance Requests
```
GET /api/maintenance-requests
POST /api/maintenance-requests
PUT /api/maintenance-requests/{id}
```

### Document Management
```
GET /api/documents
POST /api/documents/upload
DELETE /api/documents/{id}
```

### Chat System
```
GET /api/chats
POST /api/chats/send
GET /api/chats/{propertyId}/history
```

## Integration Points

### Stripe Integration
1. Payment Intent creation
2. Webhook handling for payment events
3. Refund processing
4. Payment method management

### File Storage (AWS S3)
1. Direct upload with pre-signed URLs
2. Secure file access control
3. Automatic file deletion

### WebSocket Integration
1. Authentication handshake
2. Real-time message broadcasting
3. Presence channels for online status

## Deployment Architecture
1. Load balanced web servers
2. Replicated MySQL database
3. Redis cluster for caching
4. AWS S3 for file storage
5. CloudFront CDN
6. SSL/TLS termination

## Monitoring and Logging
1. Application logs (Laravel Log)
2. Error tracking (Sentry)
3. Performance monitoring (New Relic)
4. Server monitoring (AWS CloudWatch)

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Specific payment gateway requirements beyond Stripe
2. Detailed compliance requirements for different regions
3. Backup and disaster recovery requirements
4. SLA requirements for system availability
